            <h1>Async++</h1>
            <h2>Building blocks for C++20 coroutines</h2>
            <p>The Async++ group of projects aims to provide an extensive set of libraries and wrappers for C++20's coroutines.</p>
            <p>It consists of a core library and wrappers for commonly used libraries.</p>
            <h3>Core library</h3>
            <p>
                The core library provides basic building blocks like task and generator types, a fiber implementation
                that supports interaction with coroutines, events, signals, mutex types, various concepts and interfaces. It also
                provides commonly required extensions like a timer and a dynamic thread pool implementation. In order to make usage easy
                it is entirely header only. It also supports custom allocators for most types and coroutines to allow usage in areas
                where memory allocation needs to be handled in a special way, like embedded or game applications.
            </p>

            <h3>Curl Wrapper</h3>
            <p>
                <b>asyncpp-curl</b> is a c++ wrapper around the popular libcurl library. It makes the use of asynchronous network requests
                extremly easy by wrapping curl's multi interface and providing interoperability to coroutines. On top of that foundation
                it provides convenience wrappers for the most commonly used features like http requests. It also includes a fully compliant
                (based on the autobahn-ws test) Websocket client with support for permessage compression.
            </p>

            <h3>io_uring Wrapper</h3>
            <p>
                <b>asyncpp-uring</b> is a c++ wrapper around the linux specific io_uring library. It allows for super fast I/O without sacrificing
                readability of the code. It is designed as a low-level building block for performance critical applications that can afford
                being tied to a single operating system.
            </p>

            <h3>gRPC Wrapper</h3>
            <p>
                <b>asyncpp-grpc</b> is a helper library for gRPC. It wraps the asynchronous completion queue api and provides easy to use client
                interfaces to easily consume a remote service from coroutine code without blocking the thread. It also provides a server
                side task type to allow easily building fully asynchronous server methods.
